# -------------------Exercise 1-------------------
# In mathematics, the symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.

# Two following sets are given:
# A = {2, 4, 6, 8}
# B = {4, 10}

# Using the appropriate method, extract the symmetrical difference of sets A and B and print the result to the console as shown below.

# Expected result:
# Symmetric difference: {2, 6, 8, 10}
# --------------------------------------------------

A = {2, 4, 6, 8}
B = {4, 10}

print(A.symmetric_difference(B))
