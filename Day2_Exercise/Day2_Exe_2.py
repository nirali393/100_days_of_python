# -------------------Exercise 2-------------------
# The arithmetic sequence is given with the following formula:a.log(n) = 10 + 4n
# Calculate the sum of the first ten elements of this sequence. Print the result to the console as shown below.
# Expected result: The sum of the first 10 elements in a sequence: 320.0
# --------------------------------------------------

a1 = 14
a10 = 50
n = 10
 
s10 = ((a1 + a10) / 2) * n

print(f'The sum of the first 10 elements in a sequence: {s10}')
